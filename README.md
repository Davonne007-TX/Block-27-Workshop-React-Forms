#Workshop Block 27: React Forms

Deployed Site: https://glittering-crepe-077920.netlify.app/

In this workshop, I was able to build a controlled form that will hit an external API. The API I am using is a small internal FSA APILinks to an external site. With only two routes, /signup and /authenticate.

In this workshop, I was able to set the state for username and password and associate the state values to the form as values, to have a controlled form, and having a handleSubmit function. On success, the API will send back a token, which can be stored, then pass to the server to authenticate future requests. Check out the console.log...!
